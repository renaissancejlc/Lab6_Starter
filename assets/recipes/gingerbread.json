Not too sweet. I made it thin and they came out perfectly crispy. The only thing I changed was I used heapingful of the spices required. I kept the baking soda as instructed but added 3/4 tsp of baking powder on top. used 1 cup of butter instead of 3/4 cup.  Used 2 small orange peel zest with the batter, skip the icing for less sugar consumption. Baked as required for 8 mins in a convection oven.  Best Gingerbread Cookie Recipe I ever made.

These cookies were so delicious and addictingly Tasty!! The recipe for these cookies was very clear and simple. I did however after trying three different ways of baking these that baking these close to 11minutes was the prime temp for Crispy and CHEWY cookies.. Now I am sure that individual ovens may have different characteristics about them with regard to baking. I did find that my first batch baked at 9 minutes produced a very soft and grainy texture, almost like they were not done and they weren't. Tasted mostly the sugars. So, what I did was rebake them immediately for another 2 minutes and the Twice-baked cookies were actually more chewy than the others. Thank you for your recipes and sharing the love."},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Haddie"},"datePublished":"2021-10-13","reviewBody":"Best gingerbread cookies ever!
